# ShopForBeans-Function
This is the shopForBeans function. It uses a setTimeout() function  to simulate a time-consuming asynchronous action.  
The function returns a promise with a resolved value of a string  representing a type of bean. 
It settles on a random beanType from the beanTypes array using Math.random()

Notice export and required keyword to connect both files....

Imagine creating a story.... with setTimeout
